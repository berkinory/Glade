# Workspace layout

Glade is a Bun/Turbo monorepo. Runtime ownership is split across the app workspaces, while shared schemas and cross-runtime helpers live under `packages`.

- `/apps/server` — The authoritative Glade backend and private `@glade/cli` package. Owns orchestration/persistence, provider adapters and health/discovery, Git/worktrees, terminals, automation, workspace files, HTTP/WebSocket RPC, and the bundled web client used outside Vite development.
- `/apps/web` — React + Vite application. Owns presentation, client transport/state coordination, chat/composer/editor/dock surfaces, and subscription-driven projection of server-authoritative state.
- `/apps/desktop` — Electron host for the shared web client. Supervises a desktop-scoped Glade server process and provides native window, update, IPC, browser-automation, and other OS/Electron integrations.
- `/packages/contracts` — Shared Effect Schema and TypeScript contracts for orchestration, provider/session/model data, RPC methods, settings, keybindings, automation, device/browser surfaces, and other cross-process payloads.
- `/packages/shared` — Runtime modules consumed by at least two applications, grouped into platform, transport, threads, computer, browser, git, HTTP, text, provider and workspace domains. Server-only workers, stream decoders, filesystem durability and settings merge code live in the server. Uses explicit subpath exports (for example `@glade/shared/git/git` and `@glade/shared/threads/threadWorkspace`) rather than one catch-all barrel.
- `/scripts` — Repository-level development, packaging, release, migration-lineage and smoke-test tooling. Package-specific scripts remain with their owning app when they depend on that workspace's package context or Turbo task ownership.

## Ownership rule of thumb

- Durable application truth and server-authoritative/backend side effects belong in `apps/server`.
- Browser presentation belongs in `apps/web`; desktop-only native hosting and Electron/OS side effects belong in `apps/desktop`.
- Cross-process data shapes belong in `packages/contracts`.
- Runtime utilities genuinely shared across multiple workspaces belong in `packages/shared`, whether pure or stateful/I/O-bound when the cross-runtime abstraction is intentional.
- Repository-level build/release/developer automation belongs in `/scripts`; app-specific automation stays in the owning workspace when it relies on local dependencies or package tasks.
